## The Problem: Creators Are Getting Robbed

**Right now, there are 200 million creators worldwide generating $250 billion in content value.**

But here's the brutal truth: **They own nothing.**

A viral Instagram post with 10 million views? The creator gets $0 in licensing revenue. Zero. Zilch.

A brand wants to use your viral meme in a Super Bowl ad? They screenshot it, use it, and you have **no legal recourse**.

**The current creator economy is fundamentally broken:**
- ❌ No ownership layer
- ❌ No licensing infrastructure  
- ❌ No royalty mechanisms
- ❌ Platforms extract 100% of the value from repurposing creator content

Meanwhile, traditional media has billion-dollar licensing industries. Getty Images: $3.7B valuation. Shutterstock: $1.5B. 

**Why don't creators have this?**

## The Solution: Programmable IP for Social Media

**Mint2Story transforms social media content into programmable intellectual property assets.**

Imagine if every Instagram post, TikTok video, or viral tweet was:
- ✅ **Registered as an IP asset** on-chain
- ✅ **Wrapped with smart contract licensing**  
- ✅ **Equipped with automated royalty distribution**
- ✅ **Tradeable in a global marketplace**

**This is the IP revolution creators have been waiting for.**

### How It Works (Simple)

1. **Mint** → Creator uploads content, we register it as an IP asset on Story Protocol
2. **License** → Smart contracts embed flexible licensing terms (commercial, editorial, derivatives)
3. **Monetize** → Brands discover and purchase usage rights; creators earn perpetual royalties
4. **Trade** → Assets are tradeable, creating a liquid market for digital content rights

### The Technology Stack

We're building on the **best infrastructure in Web3:**

- **Story Protocol** - The industry-standard programmable IP framework (think "Programmable IP Layer for the Internet")
- **IPFS (nft.storage)** - Decentralized, permanent storage for media and metadata
- **Supabase** - Production-grade database and authentication
- **React + TypeScript** - Modern, maintainable codebase

**This isn't vaporware. This is production-ready infrastructure.**
